      and juicy on the inside, with a perfectly seasoned, crunchy exterior.

    <h3>Ingredients List</h3>

      <li>500g chicken breast, cut into strips (tenders)</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 cup breadcrumbs (panko recommended for extra crispiness)</li>
      <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
      <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
      <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp onion powder</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
      <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
      <li>Fresh lettuce leaves</li>
      <li>Creamy dip (mayonnaise, aioli, or ranch)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps to Make</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the Chicken:</strong> Pat the chicken tenders dry with
        paper towels. Season them generously with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Set up the Breading Station:</strong> Arrange three separate
        shallow dishes: flour mixture, egg wash, and breadcrumbs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bread the Tenders:</strong> Dredge the tender in the flour
        mixture, then the egg wash, and finally coat it completely in the
        breadcrumbs, pressing firmly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Heat the Oil:</strong> Fill a pan with about 1 inch of oil. Heat
        the oil to 350°F (175°C).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fry the Chicken:</strong> Carefully place the breaded tenders
        into the hot oil. Fry for 3-4 minutes per side until golden brown and
        cooked through.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Drain and Serve:</strong> Remove the tenders and place them on a
        wire rack or paper towels to drain excess oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Assemble:</strong> Arrange a platter with fresh lettuce leaves,
        pile the crispy chicken tenders, and serve with your creamy dip.
      </li>
