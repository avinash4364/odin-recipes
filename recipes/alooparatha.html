    <h2>🥔 Aloo Paratha (Spiced Potato Stuffed Flatbread) 🌿</h2>
    <p>
      Aloo Paratha is a popular and hearty Indian flatbread stuffed with a
      flavorful, spiced mashed potato filling. It's often enjoyed for breakfast,
      lunch, or dinner and is typically served hot with a dollop of butter,
      plain yogurt (curd), or a side of pickle (achaar) and chutneys. The key to
      a perfect paratha is a soft outer layer and a well-seasoned, evenly spread
      filling.

    <h3>Steps to Make</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> Mix flour, salt, and water to knead
        a soft dough. Let it rest for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> Combine mashed potatoes with all
        the specified filling ingredients and mix thoroughly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Assemble the Paratha:</strong> Divide both the dough and the
        filling into equal-sized balls.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stuff the Dough:</strong> Flatten a dough ball, place a filling
        ball inside, pinch the edges to seal, and flatten gently.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Roll the Paratha:</strong> Lightly dust with flour and gently
        roll the stuffed ball into a 6-7 inch circle.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook the Paratha:</strong> Heat a flat griddle (tava) over
        medium-high heat. Place the paratha on the hot griddle.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Apply Ghee/Oil:</strong> Flip the paratha once bubbles appear.
        Brush ghee or oil on both sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Press and Cook:</strong> Gently press the paratha with a spatula
        until golden brown spots appear and it puffs up slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serve:</strong> Serve immediately with butter, yogurt, and your
        choice of pickle/chutney.
