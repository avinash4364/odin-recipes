    <h2>🥕 Gajar Ka Halwa (Traditional Indian Carrot Pudding) 🌰</h2>
    <p>
      Gajar Ka Halwa is a classic Indian dessert, a rich and comforting pudding
      made from grated carrots slow-cooked in milk, sweetened with sugar, and
      enriched with ghee (clarified butter) and aromatic cardamom. It's
      traditionally garnished with slivered nuts like almonds and pistachios,
      making it a beloved treat, especially during the winter months and festive
      occasions.

    <h3>Ingredients List</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1kg fresh carrots, grated</li>
      <li>1 liter full-fat milk (or whole milk)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
      <li>1/4 cup ghee (clarified butter)</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp cardamom powder</li>
      <li>
        1/4 cup mixed nuts (almonds, cashews, pistachios), slivered or chopped
      </li>
      <li>A pinch of saffron strands (optional, for color and flavor)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps to Make</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook the Carrots and Milk:</strong> Combine grated carrots and
        milk in a heavy-bottomed pan. Bring to a boil, then simmer on low heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reduce the Milk:</strong> Continue simmering and stirring until
        the milk has almost completely evaporated and the carrots are tender
        (approx. 40-60 minutes).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add Ghee and Sugar:</strong> Stir in the ghee and cook for 5-10
        minutes. Then add the sugar and mix thoroughly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sauté and Thicken:</strong> Continue to cook on medium-low heat,
        stirring constantly, until the liquid evaporates and the halwa thickens
        to a moist, pudding-like consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add Flavor and Nuts:</strong> Stir in the cardamom powder,
        saffron (if using), and most of the chopped nuts.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Garnish and Serve:</strong> Transfer to a serving bowl. Garnish
        with the remaining slivered nuts and serve warm or chilled.
      </li>
    </ol>
